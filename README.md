### No more need to run anything other than the game!

Just:

>- Download and run "**install-wsr.exe**"
>- Select the folder with the game and press "**Next**" once or twice
>- Start the game client and press **F10**
>- Insert your YouTube broadcast token and click "**Start Stream**"

### Well done. Now you can watch the broadcast of your game on YouTube!

*At the moment there are some limitations:*

>- non-adaptive resolution (always 1920x1080)
>- works only on D3D11-compatible devices (preferences are hard coded)
>- only one RTMP server is supported (YouTube)
